The International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) currently manages its courses across
nine departments manually through Excel sheets and departmental coordination. This
approach often causes inconsistency, and difficulty in tracking course offerings each
semester.
To solve this, the university’s IT Cell has proposed building a centralized RESTful API using
Spring Boot that will manage course-related data digitally and uniformly across all
departments.
The API will allow CRUD operations for courses, departments, and faculty assignments,
serving as the backend for future web or mobile applications.
